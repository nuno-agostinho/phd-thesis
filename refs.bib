@article{arenas:1987vc,
	abstract = {The splicing of messenger RNA precursors (pre-mRNA) of eukaryotic cells involves the formation of a branched RNA intermediate known as a RNA lariat. This structure is formed in the first step of the reaction when a cleavage at the 5' splice site generates the 5' exon and a RNA species containing the intron and 3' exon in which the phosphate moiety at the 5' end of the intron is forming a 2'-5' phosphodiester bond with the 2'-hydroxyl moiety of a specific adenine residue near the 3' end of the intron forming a RNA branch with the following structure: -pA2'-pX-3'-pZ-. We have purified a debranching activity approximately 700-fold from the cytosolic fraction of HeLa cells. This activity catalyzes the hydrolysis of the 2'-5' phosphodiester bond of branched RNA structures yielding a 5'-phosphate end and a 2'-hydroxyl group at the branch attachment site. The activity possessed a sedimentation coefficient of 3.5 S. The reaction catalyzed by the purified fraction requires a divalent cation and is optimal at pH 7.0. The purified activity can efficiently hydrolyze triester trinucleotide structures (pY2'-pX-3'-pZ-) prepared by digestion of RNA lariats with nuclease P1. In contrast, a 2' phosphate monoester product (-pG2'-p 3'-pC-), formed by the wheat germ RNA ligase, was not attacked.},

@article{jacob:1961uh,
	abstract = {The synthesis of enzymes in bacteria follows a double genetic control. The socalled structural genes determine the molecular organization of the proteins. Other, functionally specialized, genetic determinants, called regulator and operator genes, control the rate of protein synthesis through the intermediacy of cytoplasmic components or repressors. The repressors can be either inactivated (induction) or activated (repression) by certain specific metabolites. This system of regulation appears to operate directly at the level of the synthesis by the gene of a shortlived intermediate, or messenger, which becomes associated with the ribosomes where protein synthesis takes place.},

@article{dahm:2005wx,
	abstract = {Over the past 60 years, DNA has risen from being an obscure molecule with presumed accessory or structural functions inside the nucleus to the icon of modern bioscience. The story of DNA often seems to begin in 1944 with Avery, MacLeod, and McCarty showing that DNA is the hereditary material. Within 10 years of their experiments, Watson and Crick deciphered its structure and yet another decade on the genetic code was cracked. However, the DNA story has already begun in 1869, with the young Swiss physician Friedrich Miescher. Having just completed his education as a physician, Miescher moved to T{\"u}bingen to work in the laboratory of biochemist Hoppe-Seyler, his aim being to elucidate the building blocks of life. Choosing leucocytes as his source material, he first investigated the proteins in these cells. However, during these experiments, he noticed a substance with unexpected properties that did not match those of proteins. Miescher had obtained the first crude purification of DNA. He further examined the properties and composition of this enigmatic substance and showed that it fundamentally differed from proteins. Due to its occurrence in the cells' nuclei, he termed the novel substance ``nuclein''---a term still preserved in today's name deoxyribonucleic acid.},

	abstract = {Summary
We previously piloted the concept of a Connectivity Map (CMap), whereby genes, drugs, and disease states are connected by virtue of common gene-expression signatures. Here, we report more than a 1,000-fold scale-up of the CMap as part of the NIH LINCS Consortium, made possible by a new, low-cost, high-throughput reduced representation expression profiling method that we term L1000. We show that L1000 is highly reproducible, comparable to RNA sequencing, and suitable for computational inference of the expression levels of 81% of non-measured transcripts. We further show that the expanded CMap can be used to discover mechanism of action of small molecules, functionally annotate genetic variants of disease genes, and inform clinical trials. The 1.3 million L1000 profiles described here, as well as tools for their analysis, are available at https://clue.io.},
