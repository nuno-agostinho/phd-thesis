In a collaborative lab effort, we are also developing a Nextflow pipeline to process raw RNA sequencing data from TCGA (Cancer Genome Atlas Research Network et al., 2013) and GTEx (The GTEx Consortium, 2013) in order to provide processed gene expression and alternative splicing data from samples from multiple normal and diseased tissues. The aims of this project extend those of recount2 (Collado-Torres, 2017) and include alternative splicing analysis, as well as a complementary dashboard to help users explore the data in these data sources. We are also considering integrating the data from this project in psichomics in lieu of the limited processed data from the public sources for TCGA and GTEx.

The Nextflow pipeline we are working on is based on Docker images for portability and reproducibility. This means that only Docker and Nextflow are required to be installed in the computer running the pipeline. We intend to write a peer-reviewed article regarding this project, as well as share our scripts and processed data with the scientific community.
