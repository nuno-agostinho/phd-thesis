My PhD has been an incredible journey where I met fantastic people, some of which I could never imagine living without. A journey where I met painful challenges, some of which made me the person I am today. But no matter the obstacles, I am glad to have chosen this path for it was the one that led me to meet great new friends.

First of all, a big thank you to Nuno Morais for having me all these years: for inviting me to his lab and iMM, opening the doors to this crazy adventure.

My great ex-lab mates that taught me a lot, Marie Bordone and Lina Gallego.

- Elvira Leites, Eunice Paisana, Helena Pinheiro
- João Sabino, Ana Duarte, Madalena Almeida, Inês Faleiro

For all the nights out and partying throughout the PhD, thank you Debanjan and Vasco Conceição.

And certainly to my greatest chaperon over this whole journey, through the road's ups and downs, Mariana Ferreira.

I will carry all my friends in my heart, together with those that were already there for a long time: Alicia Calvo-Villamañán, Inês Mendes, João Pereira.

Last, but not least, one special thank you to my family who have always been there. To my grandfather, my biggest supporter, a special thank you.
