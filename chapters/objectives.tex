\chapter{Objectives}

The objectives of my work during the PhD thesis were to provide useful transcriptomic web apps to the scientific community.

First, as a continuation of the work I developed during my Master's thesis, I continued working on psichomics, an alternative splicing quantification, analysis and visualisation for TCGA data. We extended psichomics to support more data sources (including GTEx, recount2 and user-provided data), analyse gene expression, support alternative splicing quantification for 14 species, among other features.

- cTRAP: identification of candidate causal perturbations from differential gene expression data

Finally, we also developed an app server to deploy the previously mentioned tools as web apps, as well as the apps of other lab colleagues. This allows our apps to be readily available in a web browser and easily accessible to any user that visits our website.
